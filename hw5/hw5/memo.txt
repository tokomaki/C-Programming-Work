In this assignment, I learned that the memory address of the array and the 
automatic array are different from each other. I also was able to see that
the first data printed in the for loop of the main program appeared again
further down the stack. Also, I noticed that the addresses of a, b, and, c all
go up by 4 bytes, which makes sense since they are integer variables. However,
d's memory address is significantly different from the rest, starting with ff
instead.
